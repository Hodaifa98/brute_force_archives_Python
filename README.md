# brute_force_archives_Python
A script to crack an archive file (.zip) and know its password.

You can customize what characters to use, or even add numbers or special characters to the combination.

# Usage
Set the ZIP file name:

```zip_name = "secret.zip"```

Set the password length (Longer passwords will take a lot of processing power, and might block your machine):

```pass_length = 4```

```pass_length = 5```

Set the characters list (More characters will take more time to create the combinations):

```charlist = "abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz"```

```charlist = "ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ"```

```charlist = "0123456789"```

```charlist = "abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyzABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ0123456789"```
